# OOP - Shapes

Think about a few geometrical shapes:

    - triangle

    - rectangle

    - square

    - circle

Identify their similarities and differences. The common actions (behaviors) for each shape should be the ability to calculate their length (perimeter) and area.

Apply the principle of abstraction to create relevant classes for these "things". Model them using the Object-Oriented Design process we learned together. Then model the corresponding Java classes.

The public methods (the class' interface) for each class should allow you to calculate the area and perimeter for each shape.

Also, create methods which allow setting values for the properties (instance variables) of these classes. Try to create objects (make instances) of these classes in the main() method and call their methods. You can answer questions such as: "Which is the are of this circle?", or "Which is the perimeter of this rectangle?" etc.
